Jimmy Neutron. 

In 2003, an animated show about a boy genius and his inventions aired an episode titled, “Professor Calamitous, I Presume.” It introduces a recurring villain with a unique flaw. His goal in the episode is to kidnap Jimmy and force him to complete his inventions because *he can’t finish anything he starts.* To this day, Professor Calamitous sticks with me. As a kid, his weakness felt like a punchline. As an adult: I get it. Finishing stuff can be hard, especially when you’re passionate about it and you want it to be *perfect.*

*Professor Calamitous*

I used to draw a lot when I was younger. A lot a lot. I have a rubber bin of sketchbooks filled with sketches and drawings and more. I doodled in notebooks throughout school and always had a sketchbook in class. When I went to college, I began by pursuing art. It was something I liked, right? Well, it turns out that I liked drawing, but not art. I failed out of the art program because I didn’t want to do the projects or learn the history. I just wanted to create what I wanted. Failing art school didn’t sit well with my creative side. And after I left school, I stopped making time to create. Together, these two elements put me in a state of anxiety and stress whenever I tried to put pencil to paper. 

*How can I create anything good?*

*What if I can’t produce exactly what I imagine?*

*What if what I make isn’t perfect?*

I think that fear of failure led me to feel like Professor Calamitous. I would excitedly start a new sketch only to falter after the initial outline. And then it got worse. That feeling of excitement followed by disappointment and fear when I didn’t immediately see my passion manifest seeped into other parts of my life. I now have a history of discarded projects and new interests long enough for my spouse and I both to notice: *I don’t finish things.* When the going gets tough (or boring, or less exciting than the next going), I move on.

All of this is to say that I’m proud of myself for sticking with game development for over a year. This is a new skill that I’m passionate about and I am continuing at my own pace and in the way I want to learn. This isn’t my short-lived webcomic, or my half-crocheted hat, or the piles of prototype-less notes on “cool board game ideas” I’ve collected over the years. This blog is far too young to assign a camp yet, but I’m hopeful. 

So what does all of this have to do with Elden Ring? Playing a video game isn’t the same as being creative or committing to a project. But it’s tough for my brain not to notice the even longer list of unfinished games when thinking of all my discarded projects. I’ve played Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, XII, and XIII. With the exception of X, I got right up to the final boss and stopped. I replayed Super Mario 64 when the re-release pack came out on the Switch in 2021 but stopped at Tick Tock Clock. I am currently a few hours into The Witcher 2 and questioning whether I’ll go back because it’s been over a month. 

I think my relationship with unfinished games is different from unfinished projects. I give up playing because a game will stop showing me new things near the end and I lose interest. But it might also be due to difficulty spikes. Why should I put all that effort into beating Sephiroth’s million forms if this is the end of the game anyway? Story is a hard sell for me and I’d be lying if I said I clearly remember FFVII’s plot. 

So when I was excited to try out the latest From Software game - a company renowned for crafting difficult games - a part of me questioned if I was about to waste $60. I didn’t. I loved it. Elden Ring provided a sandbox filled with myriad challenges to fail, learn, and overcome. And those moments of triumph reminded me of all the times I quit instead of finishing. 

*Just because it’s not perfect, doesn’t mean it’s a failure.*

*Failure is part of the journey.*

*Fail faster.*

*There may be mild spoilers*

I love Elden Ring. Everything about this game feels intentional. The level design, the controls, the world, the combat, the enemies, the audio - it all serves a purpose and creates a product greater than the sum of its parts. But you’ve probably heard others talk about this game already. You’ve had friends playing it nonstop or heard games media rave about it. 

There are two parts of Elden Ring’s game design that I enjoyed the most: the intentional lack of modern conventions and the use of vertical space. 

Elden Ring is an open world, action, adventure, role-playing game. That is a lot of things. And that classification belongs to so many other games that have created a staple genre in modern gaming. Assassin’s Creed, Horizon Zero Dawn, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Red Dead Redemption 2, and so many more all exist in this same space and sell incredibly well. However, the industry has begun to refine the genre to the point where some of the games are becoming homogenous. And by tearing down the built up conventions of the genre, Elden Ring stands apart.

*One of my favorite encounters and I love this screenshot*

Elden Ring has no way points, quest log, and very few map markers. The game relies on visual and gameplay design to lead players to their next destination, often leaving much up for interpretation. The best open world games are those that encourage and reward exploration. By removing these conventions, the game allows players to let go of expectations about what *might* be ahead and instead discover. Searching a new area and finding a hidden cave filled with powerful enemies and treasure makes the discovery and adventure so much more memorable. Discovering a new part of the map isn’t about unlocking a new checklist of to-dos. It’s about the sense of wonder and danger from exploring something *new*. 

Outside of the discovery, Elden Ring provides players with plenty of direction. Some of the checkpoints scattered throughout the world point in the approximate direction of something worth exploring, but little indication of what. You could as easily discover the next big story boss as a castle filled with rebellious demi-humans. Other points of interest might be hinted at through cryptic NPC dialogue or sketched into the actual map of the world. For example, giant trees are a recurring motif throughout the game. The Erd Tree at the center of the world is visible from nearly anywhere outdoors, giving a sense of cohesiveness. But the world is also filled with smaller, Minor Erd Trees which can be seen from afar or are drawn into a map when you first obtain it. Players are quickly taught these trees are home to optional bosses with rewards that power up your reusable flasks. Whenever I entered a new area, I looked forward to finding a new Minor Erd Tree, sometimes two!

*Climbing a ladder in Caelid is the least dangerous activity there*

The verticality in design was my favorite aspect. Not only does the game allow jumping and double-jumping with your faithful goat-horse Torrent, but the environments and even enemies incorporate more verticality than I’m used to seeing in my games. I think this game does verticality better than most platforming games. Enemies will frequently ambush you from above, training the player to always be paying attention to the ceiling for imps or oozes, or looking to trees for birds or skeletons. Other games feel like enemies are at ground level, but Elden Ring is always looking to catch you off guard. 

The level design is where the verticality is most apparent. Out in the open world, cliffs are used to not only guide the player, but show off impressive vistas or taunt with discoveries just out of reach. And these tricks aren’t limited to exterior locations. There are multiple dungeons in which verticality plays a big role, including one consisting of a series of thin platforms down a narrow pit. Not only are you at risk of falling to your death, but enemies are just as likely to knock you off a ledge as they are to defeat you in combat. These unique spaces add an extra layer of tension that make them more memorable without being frustrating.

*A "jumping puzzle" dungeon*

All of the hype around it might make it sound like the perfect video game. But these games *are* difficult. They provide a world requiring constant vigilance to survive. Even basic enemies can and will defeat you if you relax too much. Yet Elden Ring still feels incredibly fair. Every death was a death I earned through my own greed or lack of attention. This environment forces you to learn and is quick to fail you. 

*Fail Faster*

“Fail Faster” is a creative mantra that suggests you learn the most through failing and thus you should fail frequently to learn what does and doesn’t work. When designing games, this is why the prototyping phase is so important. Getting your idea into the earliest playable form helps you see if it will actually work. If not - you get a better idea of how to improve it, or not to waste more time on it. It helps you find the fun.

*Failure is an integral part of the gameplay experience*

Elden Ring (and all Souls games for that matter) take this theory and apply it to gameplay. Your health bar is a resource that gives you margin for error, but it’s not there to stop failure. If your strategy doesn’t work for a given problem, Elden Ring is quick to kill you and ask you to try again. This lets the player rapidly test new strategies and improve themselves. While these challenges are largely combat based, they may also be related to your environmental awareness. Enemies lying in ambush force you to learn common hiding places and tactics to not fall into their traps. The levels contain deadly traps or precarious platforming asking the player to survive with their wits instead of combat reflexes. 

And so, completing this game brought about a sense of satisfaction that I’ve only recently re-discovered. Playing a video game isn’t the same as creating art, but it was easy for me to draw parallels between my knack for not finishing projects and for leaving games unfinished. One of my goals this year is to play new games, finish games, and write about them. Games are an enjoyable way for me to train myself to follow through on what I start. And after 115 hours, despite countless deaths and extreme adversity, I have added Elden Ring to my list of finished games.

*Stunning environments even in the final moments*

I give Elden Ring:

## <span style="color:green">**4.8 / 5.0**</span>

Very good.
