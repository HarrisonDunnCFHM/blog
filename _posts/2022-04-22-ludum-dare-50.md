Ludum Dare 50 marks the 8th game jam I have completed since I began my dev journey in February of 2021. There have been a few that I started but didn’t finish, too. At some point I feel I might change my tune and stop participating in favor of making full games, but I still get a lot of value from jams. 

So what is a game jam? If you’re in game development, you’re probably familiar, but only a small portion of friends in my circles are. A game jam is part competition and part community event. It asks participants (either solo or as a team) to create a game in a limited time and follow a surprise theme. Some are as short as two or three days; others last a week, a month, or even a year. Participants make their games within the time limit then spend the following weeks playing the games to provide feedback and ratings. At the end, an overall winner is declared as the best rated. This rarely comes with prizes, but some offer small rewards such as community recognition or Discord roles. 

But that’s just the rules behind a game jam. For me, the event is a set of constraints and a support system to practice seeing an idea through from concept to reality. And it’s also the perfect space to test out new ideas and learn. I don’t need to get my game working perfectly - it just needs to work. Even in the last year, I’ve tried making orthogonal, grid-based movement in at least four different ways.

A game jam is about learning and growing as a game developer. It gives me purpose to practice art, coding, and design. And this is why I hope I never lose interest in game jams. Game development is a journey of continuous learning. Nothing makes that more clear when creating a game. 

Going forward, I want to write about the game jams in which I participate. I want to write about my process while creating my game and a little about some of the games from other devs that I played. So here we go!

## Ludum Dare 50
# Theme - Delay the Inevitable

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-xorn-screenshot.png" >

<a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/results" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> uses their own website to track entries and ratings. A lot of jams will use <a href="https://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, but LD has their own community. This jam has been getting support and a lot of entries for 20 years! The lead up to Ludum Dare includes a community theme voting period. Before the jam begins, participants can see a list of the top 16 themes before the actual theme announcement. There were some good ones this time around, but **Delay the Inevitable** was not one I was excited for. Instead of brainstorming out from the theme and finding a game to match, I started by brainstorming a type of game I wanted to make and then found a setting that I could shoehorn into the theme. Here was my wishlist:

1. Limited color palette
2. Grid-based movement
3. Not a puzzle game // active gameplay

I gave up (and/or forgot about) the limited color palette pretty early on. I like the idea of making a game with a single color palette, but I enjoy making my sprites when I can find the right color for the job. 

The other two led me to want to make a game with a digging mechanic. One of the finalist themes was **Folklore** so I wanted to try to find something folklore about digging. That reminded me of a weird monster from D&D - the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17066-xorn" target="_blank">xorn</a>.   

 <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-xorn-dnd.jpeg">

The xorn was exactly what I was looking for. And so I just needed something to tie it back to the actual theme of delaying the inevitable. I started prototyping the game with the idea that I would use a hunger system that ramped up until you were unable to feed yourself, but I used a similar lose condition in another jam game with <a href="https://cfhm.itch.io/see-more" target="_blank">See More</a>. I wanted to do something different, even if just for myself. So I decided to break the hunger mechanic out into managing three stomachs that each required a different food. But I also wanted to add enemies to the game that would chase the player. That would make for a more interesting loss condition with more adventurers continuously spawning and eventually (inevitably) overrunning you. 

It seemed like it might be a good hook, but perhaps a little ambitious. And as luck would have it, I double booked myself for the weekend of Ludum Dare with seeing a show with friends and lunch with family the next day. Fortunately, Ludum Dare was trying out a new format this year: <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/test-node/extra-the-new-casual-ludum-dare-format" target="_blank">Ludum Dare Extra</a>. 

Ludum Dare typically has two categories for submission. The Compo is for entries done completely by one person. Everything must be created by one person for the jam in just 48 hours. This is the more competitive version of the jam. The other is the traditional Jam in which teams of any size have 72 hours to make something. This year introduced the Extra which gives entrants nearly three weeks. This is even more casual but presents itself as an opportunity for the community to give active feedback during development. That was the extra time that I needed to make sure I was able to fit these ambitions into my game. Or so I had hoped!

I began by prototyping the movement. Easy enough! I then started by creating the gems that the player would need to eat. I had the most fun implementing this. Not only did I want gems to randomly generate at different frequencies, but I also wanted gems too far away from the player to despawn. I think I may have been too concerned with preserving memory especially in a small jam project, but it was a fun exercise. I stored each gem’s location, color, and state (eaten versus uneaten) in lists I could pull up with their indexes. After a bit of testing, I was able to generate gems, walk away until they despawned, then return to find the same gem. Neat!

*A low quality picture of the prototype. I should remember to take better screenshots so I can write about them later!*

My goal would work best with a world that could randomly generate forever in any direction. I tried this with my <a href="https://cfhm.itch.io/unfinished-horse-nonsense" target="_blank">LD49 entry</a>, but I wasn’t happy with that implementation. In that attempt, I had set up a quad and shifted a wrapped graphic relative to player movement inputs. It ended up making the world look a little floaty. For this game, I wanted to smooth that out. I created a wrappable sprite and spent way too much time writing a script to automatically generate a copy in each of 8 directions forming a 3x3 grid. This ended up being a lot trickier than I thought and was the most time consuming part of development. If I wanted to make the game go infinitely in all directions, I also wanted to remove distant sprites because again, I was concerned with preserving memory.

The last piece to this puzzle was digging. In <a href="https://cfhm.itch.io/cb2022" target="_blank">a path alone</a>, I worked a bit with player inputs affecting a Unity tilemap. I got tiles to generate near the player but then I stored the location of each tile the player visited so the player could effectively dig without the tiles immediately refilling. And storing those values would become important for the enemy AI pathfinding. 

At this point, I had run out of time in the first weekend and decided to upload the game for playtesting and feedback on the Ludum Dare website. And this was also the first time I encountered my biggest bug: the infinite runner.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-xorn-bug.gif">         
*A bug, not a feature*

I couldn’t reproduce this bug reliably on my own, so I let it be while I worked on other parts of the game. It wasn’t until a week later when my spouse was playtesting a build that it finally clicked. In her play session, the enemies got stuck running across the screen. I copy-pasted the movement script from the player when creating the movement for the enemies. I was using a while loop to track when to stop movement:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-xorn-while-loop.png"> 
*Yep, I did that*

It turned out that when a frame was dropped, the system would skip the calculation that would break the loop and get stuck running forever in a given direction. It was an easy remedy to add an extra condition and that fixed it!

I continued by adding the three stomachs and enemies. I even added different traits tied to each stomach so that the player was empowered while on a full stomach. The game was coming along and just needed some polish elements, so I asked for more feedback. 

I happened upon a streamer trying out Ludum Dare games (Thanks, <a href="https://youtu.be/LUs4mltqVVw?t=86" target="_blank">Erkberg!</a>) The game hit about where I thought it would. He gave me some valuable feedback about adding more decision making to the player digging. In the current state, a player could theoretically dig in one direction forever and probably not lose. No good! It was this feedback that started me down the path that would lead to the lava flows in the final version. While I don’t think it perfectly solves the problem, it did create a lot more interesting gameplay patterns that forced the player to loop back around and be more thoughtful in their movement. 

There’s more polish I could put into this game, but I have to draw the line somewhere. This is a jam game and it served well as a vehicle for my learning.I look forward to using what I’ve learned here in the future!

I know this is going a bit long. I’m unsure who will even read this, if anyone. But I wanted to call out a few of my favorite games that others made during the jam. I didn’t play as many as I would have liked, but here are three I got a kick out of for one reason or another:

# <a href ="https://elephant-ld50.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Elephant In The Room</a> by binroot

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-elephant-in-the-room.png"> 

This game ended up being the #1 ranked game in the Innovative category. Elephant In The Room is less of a game and more of an experience, but it’s worth checking out. The idea is to keep the mice talking about anything other than the giant elephant in the room. This is achieved by typing anything you want into the text field and submitting. The mice will then chat about it and related topics. Very amusing!

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-rising-tide.gif"> 

Rising Tide’s creator presents it as, “A minesweeper + picross mashup that feels a little more like a strategy game than a puzzle game.” And this is totally what you get. Though the gameplay feels a little less strategic and more like guesswork at times, it’s still a really interesting combination of mechanics. Beautiful artwork and accompanying music make this a fantastic little experience that stands out in this jam. Out of a cool 2900 submissions, Rising Tide ended up at slot #17. Well done!

# <a href="https://pegasys.itch.io/market-maker" target="_blank">Market Maker</a> by Pegasus and Roitchie

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2022-04-22-ld50-market-maker.png"> 

Market Maker won’t wow anyone with graphics or audio, but it’s an interesting take on the card game for a game jam. Card games are something that I would eventually like to make but I’m not feeling like I would know how to even begin. The idea is that you’re trying to delay the collapse of your economy by bolstering the GDP while the AI uses stronger cards and effects to destroy it. This dark (realistic?) take on the economy fits really well with the theme, too. I enjoyed it enough to play more than once which is saying something for a jam game.

If you’ve made it to the end - thank you for reading! 

I plan to continue participating in game jams and hope to add write-ups like this to my blog. I plan to participate in at least three or four more jams this year including the yet to be announced GMTK2022 jam.
