The term "New Year's Resolution" comes with a lot of baggage. To me, any change in my life I give that title feels more like a wink, nod, and bold on-screen text stating, "YEAH, LIKE THAT WILL HAPPEN." So that's why I started a new thing in December and I am not calling it a New Year's Resolution despite how many similarities there are.

Last February, I started teaching myself how to make video games. I have learned how to build in Unity, code in C#, do some neat pixel art, and use GitHub to save and share my work. I have created six [games](https://cfhm.itch.io) from game jams with varying degrees of quality. I even got to watch one of my favorite YouTubers, Mark Brown of Game Maker's Toolkit, play one of my games on a [stream](https://youtu.be/qvRA_9W3UnI?t=1364). It's been a great year for learning and growing. Through all of this, I found game design to be my favorite part. I love finding the fun in what I make and sharing that with people. 

And what's a great way to study game design? Play video games? Play more? That's too good to be true. I love doing that already! 

To make sure I play games with a critical eye, I want to do two things. The first is to track and rate my plays. I spent too much time making a fancy Google Sheets doc that I can track and rate my plays. I created a rating scale where I can give everything from game design, narrative, and music to gameplay fun, ease of learning, and world-building a score from 0 to 5. I can even give a category extra weighting if I think that category is especially important for a game. 

The second thing I want to do is *this*. I want to write about the games I have played so I can practice writing and speaking my thoughts on game design. So without any more delay, here's the point of this post:

## The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut (PC)

# Combat For His Monsters

Lauren and I recently re-watched season 1 of Netflix's The Witcher so we could enjoy season 2. I remember the first group of episodes feeling disjointed and not really doing it for me. However, the second outing won me over. I got really into the world and was inspired to give the games another go. I've tried Witcher 2 and 3 a few times over the years and they just didn't click. But if there's one thing I know about myself, it's that I will play any game if I'm invested in the world. Even if that game is not great.

The first entry in The Witcher series is not a great game. A good friend recommended I skip it if I want to know why he loves the series. And I can see why a lot of the community agrees with that sentiment. The combat is atrocious. For a game carried by its narrative and world-building, it has to deal with a frustratingly heavy combat system. 

One of the first tutorials in The Witcher asks you to pick a camera mode. You can choose between over-the-shoulder (default) or you can choose overhead isometric. Being given this choice put the entire rest of the game in perspective. This game felt like it was designed to be a tribute to classic CRPG titles: you click things to attack, you can hold ALT to highlight interactable items, and you can even enable click-to-move. I haven't done the research to back this up, but it feels like the over-the-shoulder camera was added late in development because it was the right choice. It just feels better. 

All of this is to say that the combat system feels like it belongs in a different genre. There is a surprising amount of depth in your choice of sword, style, and magic, but the act of attacking comes down to a really shoddy QTE (QuickTime Event). Clicking an enemy initiates a series of attacks. Somewhere near the end of the multi-swing animation, the cursor will light up to give you the chance to add on to your combo. However, if you do anything during the animation, your attack is stopped. This includes moving or even clicking again before the icon prompts for a combo. This led to my first few minutes of the game watching Geralt harmlessly flail his sword over his head as I kept clicking, wondering why I couldn't attack. I eventually figured it out, but this felt really bad. I eventually go the hang of combat, but it rarely ever felt good. In later stages of the game where enemy stuns are more common and you're more likely to be fighting enemies of different types (that require different swords and styles), this combat system turns from slow and frustrating to downright infuriating. 

However awful the combat felt, the game was still really enjoyable. This is entirely due to the narrative and world-building. I usually prefer games that are driven by play and interesting systems over narrative. I had a conversation with a friend a few weeks prior about how it's a lot harder for me to get invested in narrative heavy games. The world of The Witcher won me over though (I'm sure the show helped). And I learned The Witcher isn't about fighting monsters and going on quests. The Witcher is a dark fantasy detective game! Well, sort of. 

The story is broken into chapters in which you're introduced to a cast of characters and an event that concerns them. The first chapter is based around hunting a hellhound that has been plaguing a small village, but later chapters focused less on monsters and more on the characters. The general loop of a chapter involved meeting all of the major players, learning their motives, finding out most of them are lying (but not because they're guilty), and then a showdown with some big bad. 

The other half of the narrative structure was the player agency given over the course of the game. I have played plenty of games where you get to choose how the story turns out, but none have felt quite as impactful as this. Perhaps it was the time spent learning the characters and their stories that made it feel this way. But when I was given the choice to help or hunt the Scoia'tael, I was genuinely torn. The Scoia'tael are a group of radical non-humans fighting for racial equality. When I was introduced to them, I wanted to help them. I wanted to help their cause. But it became apparent they were also violent and frequently attacked otherwise innocent people. I was for their cause, but their methods turned it from an obvious choice to one that I really needed to think about. I'm still not sure I made the right choice. The fact that I'm still thinking about this two weeks after I played the scene helps me understand how impactful this story was for me. 

Before ending, I wanted to call out the animation and voice acting. It's funny. It's bad but in that "so bad it's good kind of way." From Geralt's wild, flailing, heavy attack animation, the instant kills, or Triss's head bob and shrug, the animations always had me chuckling. This is an older game, so I didn't mind and it was never bad enough to ruin a scene for me. The voice acting is also pretty bad. Geralt's stiffness is the only one that works. Dandelion (Jaskier in the show) is a bard, but has some of the worst delivered lines in the game. It makes me wish I had recorded my gameplay just so I could share some of the absurd dialogue. 

Overall, I gave The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut a 3.5/5. 

If you've made it this far: thank you. Thank you for indulging me. Here's hoping this isn't just a New Year's Resolution. I want to do this more. My next game will probably be Witcher 2, Pokemon Legends Arceus, or some random impulse buy. I also need to finish The Ruined King.
