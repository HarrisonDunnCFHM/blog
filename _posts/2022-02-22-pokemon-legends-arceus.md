Sometime in 1999 a 10 year old me saved up to buy a Game Boy Pocket. Ice blue bundled with The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I had never heard of Zelda, but I was glad to have something to play on my very own handheld console! I didn't have to share with my brother. Soon after, a friend let me borrow his favorite game. That was the first time I tried Pokemon and I was hooked. Recess conversations and classroom daydreams were dominated by Pokemon as I suspect was the case for many kids in those days. I remember the moment when I realized the cartoons my family watched in the morning had the same characters as the game I chose to play instead. My young brain was overwhelmed.

Many of my memories are tied to these games. I remember "borrowing" my brother's Magmar when he was swimming so I could complete my Pokedex before him in the original Red Version. I felt like Team Rocket. But competent. I remember reading Game Informer magazine and being overcome with excitement when I learned about Pokemon breeding in Gold and Silver. My young self wondered what kind of Pokemon you'd get if you left a Snorlax and a Caterpie with the daycare. And I also remember being disappointed by the entire system. I remember riding bikes with a friend from my dad's house to GameStop to buy Emerald version the morning it was released. I let my friend use my old bike that ended up having a flat and he had to work three times as hard to make the trip. Sorry! And I remember the first time I didn't finish a Pokemon game: Pokemon Pearl version on the DS. 

I'm not sure what it was about the first Pokemon games on DS, but I still don't have strong feelings about Gen IV. Google suggests I would have been a senior in high school when it was released at the end of 2006. Maybe I felt I thought I should be too old for these games. Maybe I was turned off by the double screens and touch control gimmicks. Maybe I was no longer the target audience. I went on to try out Black & White, X & Y, Sun & Moon, and even Sword & Shield, but I never rediscovered that same magic. I played through Let's Go Eevee, but it wasn't memorable. I still get excited at the idea of discovering new Pokemon, but the games don't feel good anymore. Even following spoilers and reveals online has lost its shine. 

So I find it fitting that the first Pokemon game in nearly 15 years that I really enjoyed takes place in the same setting as the Diamond and Pearl games that I blame for putting me off the series. 

## Pokemon Legends: Arceus (Switch)
# Creatures From Hisuian Myth

*There will be mild spoilers!*

Legends Arceus was hyped (by the community) as Pokemon's "Breath of the Wild" in that it would reinvent the series like Zelda did at the start of the Switch's life cycle. I think it's an admirable attempt, but it feels half-hearted. Zelda fully committed to reinventing itself while Game Freak, the developer since the original Red and Blue versions, still seems to be holding back. Arceus makes many welcome changes to the decades old series, but still feels dated in many ways. The turn-based battling is still simplified to a fault, the battle meta is still overly complex, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the graphics in this brand new AAA video game in 2022. 

Still, for all it's faults, Pokemon Legends: Arceus might just be my Game of the Year. We've got a ton of releases to look forward to, but the sense of wonder and exploration I had while playing always had me excited for more. I have a habit of getting bored near the end of a game when it stops introducing new ideas, but I enjoyed this world so much that I finished both the normal game and the post-game. 

For those that haven't played or heard much, the core concept is pretty simple. You're tasked with researching Pokemon in a time before the main games. Pokemon exist in this world, but they're mysterious and often feared creatures instead of the loveable battle partners of the modern-era games. The core loop involves adventuring into the wilderness, researching Pokemon by capturing and battling, then turning in your research and quests for rewards that progress your power and the story. The key piece is that you can capture Pokemon *without* battling. Gone are the days of requiring you to beat a Bidoof within an inch of its life before you can add it to your collection. Instead, we have what may be the best form of "just throw a Pokeball" that Pokemon Go and the Let's Go games introduced. You can sneak up on wild monsters, distract them with snacks, or stun them by throwing items. I had read some complaints about this method making all the Pokemon feel too same-y, but their behavior in the wild gave plenty of design room for the developers. For example, a skittish Starly might fly away if it sees you while a curious Budew might follow you around. My favorite was Machoke, the muscle bound Gen I weirdo. A wild Machoke ran up to me and started flexing to show off. But when I turned my back to gather some ore, he got mad and attacked! This level of expressed behavior meant very little for gameplay, but made a world of difference for immersion and that sense of wonder. I love it. 

Capturing without battling has another huge impact on the game in the pacing. Previous entries in the series grind to a halt as you’re forced to battle hordes of Zubats, Digletts, and Pidgeys moving from point A to point B. While a veteran player can use the type advantages to make quick work of these encounters, you’re still forced through the process of a battle: screen wipe, intro text, menu navigation, more text, animations, even more text, then repeat until the encounter is over. And you can’t skip this or you miss out on the valuable experience required to actually progress. Legends Arceus, on the other hand, rewards your team with experience for doing everything from battling to simply catching monsters. Even gathering resources rewards you with experience. And when you find yourself in a battle, you will find the system has been streamlined in favor of pacing, too. Pokemon levels mean significantly less as everything does more damage. Any battle could mean trouble if you’re careless, but they can still be ended quickly without slowing down your pace of exploration. This also means you don’t feel punished by using your level 30 Pokemon to challenge a level 50. 

All of this works to emphasize exploration and de-emphasize battling. With battling taking the second chair, the rest of the game is left to shine. It encourages you to bring more and different Pokemon with you on each excursion. You no longer feel punished by needing to grind out experience on a new Pokemon before you can try them out on your team. I really enjoyed the freedom in this game when it came to team building. 

However, this also highlights one of my few real issues with the game: *battling feels tacked on*. It’s a Pokemon game, so it has to have battling, right? This is what it feels like when random NPCs that you’ve been conversing with suddenly decide they’ll only do the thing you’ve been discussing if you can best them in a battle. Or even worse - near the end, a character reveals themselves to be a ninja assassin. They go on and on about how much they have wanted to take you out over the entire game, but then decide battling Pokemon is the only way to do this? It’s just silly. This game could have been all exploration and no battling and may have been better for it. Think open world Pokemon Snap. With crafting. 

And the battle system, despite adding a new "attack speed/power" choice for the player to make, still feels too old. Why are we limited to four moves? Why am I only allowed to field one Pokemon, but my opponents (including other trainers!) can field as many as four!

And while the game gives you plenty of ways to interface with the previously tedious EVs and nature mechanics, why are these even still in the game? Surely the "hardcore" audience has been thoroughly alienated by Nintendo and Game Freak's continued lack of support. I'm not and have never been a competitive Pokemon player, so take this opinion with a grain of salt. All of these mechanics feel like they're ripe for trimming, but we won't see them ever truly removed because *it's Pokemon*.

Whining aside, all of the weirdness around battle was further emphasized by the real time encounters throughout the game. The main story involves the player “quelling the frenzied Noble Pokemon.” The revered god-like Pokemon of the Hisui region have gone berserk and won’t even participate in traditional battles. Instead, these boss battles are more like 3rd person action games. You have to evade their attacks and find openings to counter before you can initiate a traditional turn based battle. This system felt great and I hope they expand upon this in the future. So why force the player into meaningless turn-based battles against non-hostile NPCs? Oh, that's right. It's a Pokemon game. You have to battle trainers. 

Wild pokemon may also outright attack the player. Throughout the environment, there are hyper aggressive Alpha Pokemon - larger versions of the original monster with glowing red eyes. These will often attack the player on sight and are much more difficult to subdue and capture. The Alphas can be traditionally battled, but you also have the option of dodging and stunning them with items. These encounters feel much more rewarding to tackle as the player instead of behind your team of monsters. 

My first Pokemon game was a fundamental part of my youth. I will always remember the sense of discovery when finding a new area and encountering a new monster. And despite being an only mildly jaded adult gamer, I felt a small tickle of that same sense of discovery. It was a very similar feeling to playing Breath of the Wild in that there was nearly always something just within render distance (much smaller than Zelda) that sparked curiosity. I think this is Legends Arceus's strongest feature - the ability to capture that element of adventure that is so desperately missing from the main line Pokemon games. Over the course of play, you're gradually introduced to new characters and monsters, but also new ways to travel the vast land of Hisui. Revisiting old areas feels rewarding when you can tick off a few new tasks and capture new Pokemon using newly acquired abilities. In addition to the ever-present “Gotta Catch ‘Em All” directive, there are multiple other collectibles that make exploring the world feel more rewarding. Whether tracking down Unown from encrypted riddles or scouring the night time landscape for purple wisps, I found myself invested in exploring every inch of Hisui. There are also a plethora of meaningful side quests in the form of requests from villagers. These requests not only reward items or resources, but can also unlock new shop inventory or features in the hub village. But the best part about helping this settlement learn about Pokemon is the gradual expansion of the town itself. As you complete quests, the village changes to include more buildings and more Pokemon, including many that you capture and give to villagers. Over the course of the game, your town goes from a sparsely populated huddle of buildings to a thriving community with plenty of humans and Pokemon. It brought so much joy to see my Onix helping the farmers or knowing the story behind the Chimeco sitting underneath the eaves of a home. 

Either you like Pokemon or you don’t. If you’ve liked it at some point but feel the main games aren’t for you anymore, I would strongly recommend this. I wouldn’t say this has redeemed the Pokemon series for me, but it gives me hope that we’ll see more like this in the future. 

I give Pokemon: Legends Arceus:

Pretty fun despite what feels like many intentional flaws.
